I primarily focus on these areas:

- Ruby with Rails for CRUD or content heavy web applications
- Golang for command line tools, performance critical components and as a backend for single page javascript applications
- Javascript with react for single page applications
- Serverless frontend applications
- Container based deployments
- Occasional mobile development
