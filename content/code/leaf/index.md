I learn japanese using flashcards and found that available solutions
were either hard to manage or spaced-repetition algorithm didn't work
well for me. This projects started as just a benchmark between popular
spaced-repetition algorithms but I ended up expanding it with a review
interface and simple word database management using org-mode files.
