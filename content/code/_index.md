Some of the contributions I made:

- Implemented [policy
  audit](https://cilium.io/blog/2020/06/22/cilium-18/#policy-audit-mode)
  mode for Cilium, helped with setting up a [helm
  repository](https://cilium.io/blog/2020/02/18/cilium-17#helm-3-and-helm-repository)
  and made various [smaller
  changes](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aap4y+is%3Aclosed).

- Improved authentication of the
  [go-socks5](https://github.com/armon/go-socks5/pull/6) and fixed TCP
  socket leak in
  [goproxy](https://github.com/elazarl/goproxy/pull/161).

- Extended search capabilities of the [administrate
  gem](https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate/pull/1203).

- Implemented BNF based syntax indentation for
  [swift-mode](https://github.com/swift-emacs/swift-mode/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Aap4y).

You can check my linux and emacs configs [here](https://github.com/ap4y/dotfiles).

Source code for this website can also be found on [github](https://github.com/ap4y/ap4y_me).

This website is hosted at my
[homelab](/2020/06/10/homelabbing-with-kubernetes/) on a tiny
kubernetes cluster. You can check kubernetes config on
[github](https://github.com/ap4y/infra).

I occasionally do [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/ap4y/) code puzzles. You
can check my submissions in [this repository](https://github.com/ap4y/leetcode).
