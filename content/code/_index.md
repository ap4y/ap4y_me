I often make apps for myself and my family when I'm unable to find
suitable alternative. I have put highlights below, the rest of the code
along with my contributions to other projects can be found in my
[github](https://github.com/ap4y) profile.

You can check my linux and emacs configs [here](https://github.com/ap4y/dotfiles).

I occasionally do [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/ap4y/) code puzzles. You
can check my submissions in [this repository](https://github.com/ap4y/leetcode).

Source code for this website can also be found on [github](https://github.com/ap4y/ap4y_me).
