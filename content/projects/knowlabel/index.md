Web application that aims to improve work conditions for a clothing industry. I worked on implementing various analytics dashboards for suppliers, brands and workers. I was also responsible for APIs that were used by mobile devices and implemented embedded API gateway software for IoT devices deployed to factories. Technologies I used:

- Ruby on Rails for dashboards, admin UIs and RESTful APIs
- Golang for the gateway running on ARM devices
- d3.js for various graphs
