He offered suggestions on how to improve our product, quickly handled customer service requests, and began to become an integral part of our solution from day one. He has excellent communication skills and can work successfully with the varying time zones of both his clients, customers, and vendors. I highly recommend Arthur and his work product."

Web application for a proxy services provider. I was involved in tasks across the platform trying to scale product up. Some of the things I worked on:

- Implementation of the HTTP and SOCKS5 proxies and auxiliary services (billing and log collectors, credential managers and health monitoring). My main focus was on improving reliability and visibility of the proxy deployments. All these services were written in golang.

- Ruby dashboard application. I performed upgrade from rails 3 to rails 5, implemented and released re-designed version, replaced old jquery code with vue.js components.

- I managed large fleet of AWS EC2 VMs located in 10 different regions.

- I was also involved in the customer support and on boarding.
