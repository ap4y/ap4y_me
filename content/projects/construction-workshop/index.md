Website for a local engineering company using serverless paradigm: all content is editable and static pages are automatically built on publish. Tools I used: 

- Hugo for templating and content management
- scss for styling with postcss and css-next
- es6 via babel
- webpack for bundling
- forestry as a static CMS
