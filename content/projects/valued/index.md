Web application that connects job seekers with employees based on the lifestyle values. This app provides variety of tools and dashboards for jobs seekers and companies. 

Tools I used:

- Ruby on Rails for API: authorization and authentication, stripe subscriptions and image uploads
- React.js with redux for frontend
- next.js for server side rendering
- emotion for css-in-js
- es6 via babel
- heroku
