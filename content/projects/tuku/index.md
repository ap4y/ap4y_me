Web page for a MƒÅori winemakers collective. Project has complex layout with significant transformations via media queries, range of different animations and a bit of javascript code. I have used webpack as a build system and this allowed me to use modern frontend technologies: es6 via Babel and css-next with autoprefixer via postcss.
