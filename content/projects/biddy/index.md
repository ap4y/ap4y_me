Marketplace for secondhand clothes with ability to donate some of the profits towards various funds. Things I worked on:

- Developed creative and challenging iOS app with a lot of custom views and animations
- Developed large RESTful api and admin pages
- Integration with APNS via custom proxy service written in golang
- Video and image uploads and processing
- All components of the system are localized to the dutch and english, seamless switching for users
- A lot of email and push notifications across the system with interesting triggering logic
- Comprehensive test suite for the backend and integration tests for the whole system
